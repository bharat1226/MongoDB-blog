### Travel Blog using Mongo-DB and Bottle-Framework(python)
  In this web-application, MVC architecture is used. The model manages the data of the application. MongoDB is used in this application which is a non-relational database. It responds to the request from the view and it also responds to instructions from the controller to update itself. The data is displayed to the end-user via templating engine. Bottle-framework is used as server. This application is programmed in python programming language. The data is displayed to user in web browser and user can control the data and manipulate it. Controller is responsible for responding to user input and perform interactions on the data objects. The controller receives the input, it validates the input and then performs the business operation that modifies the state of the data model.
